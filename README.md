1.Introduction  
This project demonstrates the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification â€” specifically, classifying whether an image contains a stop sign or not. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and is intended as a complete demonstration of a modern deep learning workflow, from data preparation to deployment-ready prediction scripts.  

2.Problem Statement  
The task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between images containing stop signs and those that do not. Applications of such a system include autonomous driving, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and traffic surveillance, where robust detection of road signs is critical.  

3.Dataset Used  
Classes: Stop signs and Not Stop signs, organized into:  

    data/stop/
    data/not_stop/

Download the dataset: 

    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1818x1ukoJy8UHIbItOYJ_25ssh-U3gp3?usp=sharing
Instructions:  
Download and unzip the dataset.    
Place the stop and not_stop folders inside a new data/ directory at the project root.    
The final structure should be:  

    data/
      stop/
      not_stop/

4.Model Architecture  
* Framework: TensorFlow (Keras API)
* Input Size: 64x64 RGB image

* Network Layers:
  Conv2D(32, 3x3, relu) + MaxPooling2D(2x2)
  Conv2D(64, 3x3, relu) + MaxPooling2D(2x2)
  Flatten
  Dense(64, relu) + Dropout(0.5)
  Dense(2, softmax)

* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

5.Instructions for Running the Code
* Prerequisites
* Python 3.7+
* pip

  i. Clone the repository
  
      git clone https://github.com/sudharsan-3699/stop-sign-classifier/  
      cd stop-sign-classifier

  ii. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
  
      python -m venv venv
      # Windows:  
        venv\Scripts\activate  
      # Mac/Linux:  
        source venv/bin/activate  

  iii. Install All Dependencies

      pip install -r requirements.txt

  iv. Add Your Data
    * Place stop sign images in data/stop/
    * Place non-stop images in data/not_stop/
    * Images should be jpg/png format.

  v. Clean the Dataset
  
      python scripts/run_clean.py

  vi. Train the Model
  
      python scripts/run_train.py

  vii. Predict on a New Image
  
      python scripts/run_predict.py path/to/test_image.jpg


6. Implementation Steps  
    * Data Preparation: Collected and organized images into separate folders (stop, not_stops).
    * Preprocessing: Cleaned images to remove corrupt files using Pillow.
    * Model Construction: Defined and tested CNN model architecture in Keras.
    * Training: Performed efficient data loading, augmentation, and training with validation monitoring.
    * Evaluation: Recorded validation performance and manually sampled prediction outputs.
    * Documentation: Provided code, usage instructions, and explanatory comments.
    * Testing: Used script to batch predict and visualize sample images.

7. Insights and Challenges
    * Data Cleaning: Some images were corrupt or incorrectly formatted, requiring an automated cleanup step.

    * Environment Management: Faced and resolved pip/venv confusion to ensure all packages installed locally.

    * Accuracy vs. Complexity: A simple CNN architecture proved effective for this binary classification task, highlighting the importance of good data, preprocessing, and clear labeling.

    * Reproducibility: The script-based project structure (no notebooks required) makes this project easy to reproduce or modify for similar image classification tasks.

    * Further Improvements: Possible enhancements include data augmentation, transfer learning, and deployment as a web API.
